# 🌟 StarqueZZ

**StarqueZZ** is a **Progressive Web App (PWA)** that gamifies chore tracking and rewards for children aged 5–8, specifically designed for Zen and Zia. The app transforms daily responsibilities into engaging quests where children earn stars for completing chores and can redeem them for real-world rewards set by parents.

- **Personal Profiles**: Each child has their own login, avatar, and progress tracking
