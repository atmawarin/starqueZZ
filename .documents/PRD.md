# Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Product: StarqueZZ

### Summary
StarqueZZ is a PWA that gamifies chores for kids aged 5â€“8. We are replacing Supabase auth with Clerk to simplify authentication, improve reliability, and unlock hosted UI flows and MFA. Backend data remains mocked during prototyping; future persistence will be added later.

### Goals
- Encourage consistent chore completion via stars and rewards
- Provide parents with tools to manage tasks, rewards, and themes
- Deliver a secure, simple sign-in/sign-up using Clerk

### Assumptions
- Prototype phase uses mock JSON + IndexedDB; no server-side persistence yet
- Children may use shared devices; parents manage accounts
- Offline-first behavior is necessary for family usage patterns

### Users & Roles
- Parent: manages tasks, rewards, themes; oversees progress
- Child: completes tasks, earns stars, views progress
- Roles stored in Clerk user metadata

### Key Features (MVP)
1) Authentication (Clerk)
- Hosted or embedded sign-in/sign-up
- Session management and user profile via Clerk
- Basic role metadata (parent/child) captured on first run or via parent settings

2) Task System
- Two daily core tasks must be completed; additional tasks count only afterwards
- Earn 1 star per day for core completion; 50% weekly bonus for perfect streaks

3) Parent Dashboard
- Create/edit tasks and rewards
- Assign themes per child
- Review weekly progress

4) Offline Support
- Persist local state in IndexedDB (Dexie)
- Service Worker asset caching

### Non-Goals (MVP)
- Server-side data persistence
- Social features or public leaderboards
- Payments

### Success Metrics
- Daily task completion per child
- % of parents active weekly in dashboard
- 30/60/90-day retention
- PWA performance and offline reliability

### UX Requirements
- Simple, large touch targets for kids
- Clear visual feedback on completion (stars, animations)
- Parent flows protected; sign-in gate via Clerk
- Use shadcn and Tailwind for consistent design

### Technical Requirements
- Wrap app with `<ClerkProvider>`
- Replace any `authMiddleware` with `clerkMiddleware` for protected routes
- Store `VITE_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` in `.env` and host; reserve `CLERK_SECRET_KEY` for future server use
- Keep user role metadata in Clerk; check on protected views/components

### Risks & Mitigations
- Role misconfiguration: add validation and default role assignments
- Offline conflicts: design clear local precedence; plan for future sync
- Child privacy: minimize PII; rely on Clerk for auth security

### Open Questions
- What backend will we adopt post-prototype for persistence?
- Will children authenticate directly, or use device-level auth with parent presence?
- How to verify chore completion integrity beyond UI controls?

### Rollout Plan
- Phase 1: Integrate Clerk auth and protect parent views
- Phase 2: Solidify role metadata and onboarding flows
- Phase 3: Add server persistence and secure APIs using Clerk JWTs
